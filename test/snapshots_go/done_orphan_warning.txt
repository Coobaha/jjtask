$ jjtask done zs

⚠️  Task is empty - no changes to mark done
If this is a planning-only task, this warning can be ignored.


⚠️  Working copy (@) has uncommitted changes:
work.txt | 1 +
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 0 deletions(-)
Were any of these changes part of this task?


Warning: zs marked done but not in @'s ancestry (orphan tasks)
These tasks were never 'wip' - their specs won't be in linear history.

Options:
  1. Consolidate specs into @ description, then abandon tasks
  2. Linearize into ancestry (may conflict)
  3. Leave as-is (manual cleanup later)
